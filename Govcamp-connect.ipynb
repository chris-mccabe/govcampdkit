Over the past two months, the patient has had a protracted ICU course complicated by recurrent infections, acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), and prolonged mechanical ventilation due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

      "Possible causes:\n",
      "- Primary lung cancer\n",
      "- Metastatic cancer from another site\n",
      "- Tuberculosis\n",
      "- Pneumonia\n",
      "- Granulomatous disease (e.g., sarcoidosis)\n",
      "- Hamartoma\n",
      "\n",
      "Documentation and Probabilities:\n",
      "1. CT scans - Required to evaluate size, extent of spread, and potential diagnosis.\n",
      "   - Probability: High for diagnosing cancer or infectious processes.\n",
      "2. Biopsy - Required to confirm the nature of the mass with certainty.\n",
      "   - Probability: High if the lesion is considered suspicious on imaging but not definitive.\n",
      "3. Sputum culture/PCR - May be useful in identifying infections, especially if there's a history of fever or productive cough.\n",
      "   - Probability: Moderate for diagnosing infectious processes, depending on symptoms and previous tests.\n",

      "Based on the image provided, it is most likely that further imaging (CT scans) followed by a biopsy will be needed to definitively diagnose the cause of the abnormal mass. Once diagnosed, treatment plans can vary widely depending on whether the mass is cancerous or benign and if it is infectious or non-infectious. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. If primary lung cancer is confirmed, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or surgery could be considered based on factors such as stage, histology, and patient fitness.\n",
      "2. In cases of metastatic cancer, treatment would typically focus on the primary site's management and palliative care to address symptoms.\n",
      "3. If tuberculosis is diagnosed, antibiotic therapy with a combination of drugs is standard for an extended period (typically 6-9 months).\n",
      "4. For benign masses like hamartomas or granulomas, conservative monitoring may be the appropriate course of action unless there are complications or risks to the patient's health.\n",
